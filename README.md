Here I will upload demos of design model.
Every week I have two design pattern class, on wednesday and on friday. After class, I will upload demos for save and share.
Of course, I will try to update on time and write docs and README to introduce what circumstances the codes are trying to simulate when coding.
After all, it does will help myself a lot.
